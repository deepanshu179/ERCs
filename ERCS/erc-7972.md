## Abstract

This EIP introduces a `UniversalComplianceRouter` contract that acts as a universal compliance layer for RWA security tokens. It allows dynamic registration of compliance modules, each associated with a function selector. The router performs aggregated compliance checks by invoking these modules with user-specific parameters such as jurisdiction using staticcall method. This enables flexible, composable, and upgradable compliance enforcement across jurisdictions and asset classes.


## Motivation

Tokenized RWAs such as real estate, equities, and bonds must comply with jurisdictional regulations (e.g., KYC/AML, accredited investor status). Hardcoding compliance logic into token contracts is inflexible and non-scalable. This EIP proposes a universal router that:

- Supports modular compliance logic
- Enables jurisdiction-specific enforcement
- Allows dynamic updates to compliance rules
- Promotes reuse of compliance modules across ecosystems

## Specification

Note: The interface and implementation below can be extended to include KYC levels and other KYC/AML checks as parameters in the isCompliant function. The core idea is to allow the registration of compliance frameworks or sub-proxies within the Universal Compliance Router, each exposing a unified callable selector for a specific category of compliance contracts.The registered sub-router/proxy or compliance contract counts in the Universal Compliance Router should be optimized to reduce the computational cost associated with looping operations.

## Rationale

On-chain compliance solutions for real-world assets (RWAs) are currently fragmented across different protocols and implementations. Each project often creates its own logic for enforcing regulatory requirements like KYC, AML, or jurisdictional restrictions. This siloed development leads to:

Lack of interoperability between compliance mechanisms across protocols

Duplication of effort in building and auditing similar compliance logic

Barriers to composability, preventing seamless integration between token contracts, marketplaces, and identity providers

The UniversalComplianceRouter consolidates these disparate efforts by introducing a standardized, modular interface to manage and invoke compliance checks. Instead of enforcing rules in isolation, this router allows smart contracts to delegate compliance verification to dynamically registered modules, each responsible for a specific rule set (e.g., "US Accredited Investor", "EU Retail AML", etc.).

By standardizing how compliance modules are invoked—using staticcall to ensure safety and composability—this router enables:

Composable compliance checks that can be reused across assets and jurisdictions

Dynamic rule updates without upgrading token contracts or duplicating logic

Shared infrastructure that fosters cooperation between identity providers, compliance vendors, and token issuers

This approach promotes network effects within EVM ecosystems, allowing compliant actors to interoperate with one another through a common compliance routing standard. As adoption grows, so does the value and utility of each registered module, creating a compounding benefit for the broader on-chain RWA ecosystem.
